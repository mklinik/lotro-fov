How to use
----------

There are two versions of this cheat table, one for the 32-bit client and one for the 64-bit client.
If you don't know what this means, you need the 32-bit version.

1. Download the cheat table corresponding to the lotro client you are using:
   `lotro-3rd-person-FOV-32bit.CT` or `lotro-3rd-person-FOV-64bit.CT`
1. Install [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/)
1. Start lotro, log in and go into the game. Make sure that the camera is in
   3rd-person view. This mod does not work for first-person view, so don't be
   zoomed all the way in.
1. Tab out to windows and start Cheat Engine. Cheat Engine also comes in 32-bit
   and 64-bit variants. Choose the one that matches the lotro client you are
   running.
1. Attach Cheat Engine to the running lotro process. To do this, click on the
   attach to process icon (marked red in the screenshot below), then select the
   process of the lotro client. If you have the launcher running, make sure to
   attach to the client not the launcher.

   lotro client: 32-bit or 64-bit.
